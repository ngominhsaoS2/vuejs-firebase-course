SECTION 2: Vue Basics
6. How to use Vue (using the CDN)
We can use Vue in 2 different ways: as a SPA and as a standalone component in a HTML page.
CDN: <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@next"></script>
    - @next means the latest version
    - we can specify a specific version <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3.0.2"></script>


7. Creating a Vue App
We could define template on the app.js file. Another way is define right at the root div (which has id="app")


9. Methods & Click Events
v-on:click is a directive.
@click is short for v-on:click.


10. Conditional Rendering
v-if
v-else
v-show

v-if and v-show might bring the same result, but they are actually different.
    - v-if removes the dom when v-if=false
    - v-show just hides the dom when v-show=false, the dom still exists.

There for, sometimes v-show is more effectively.


11. Other Mouse Events
It always has event as the first param of method.
When you want to pass in some other params, and you also want to use the event param, you have to pass in like:
    handleEvent($event, 5)


12. Outputting Lists (v-for)


13. Attribute Binding
v-bind:href="url"
Short is just :href="url"


14. Dynamic Classes
