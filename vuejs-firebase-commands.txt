SECTION 1: Introduction and Setup
4. Environment Setup
Extensions need to be install
- Live server

SECTION 2: Vue Basics
6. How to use Vue (using the CDN)
We can use Vue in 2 different ways: as a SPA and as a standalone component in a HTML page.
CDN: <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@next"></script>
    - @next means the latest version
    - we can specify a specific version <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3.0.2"></script>


7. Creating a Vue App
We could define template on the app.js file. Another way is define right at the root div (which has id="app")


9. Methods & Click Events
v-on:click is a directive.
@click is short for v-on:click.


10. Conditional Rendering
v-if
v-else
v-show

v-if and v-show might bring the same result, but they are actually different.
    - v-if removes the dom when v-if=false
    - v-show just hides the dom when v-show=false, the dom still exists.

There for, sometimes v-show is more effectively.


11. Other Mouse Events
It always has event as the first param of method.
When you want to pass in some other params, and you also want to use the event param, you have to pass in like:
    handleEvent($event, 5)


12. Outputting Lists (v-for)


13. Attribute Binding
v-bind:href="url"
Short is just :href="url"


14. Dynamic Classes


17. Computed Properties
Computed Property is the property that depends on other data.
When the depended data changes, the computed property will change too.


SECTION 3: The Vue CLI (for Bigger Projects)
19. How to Use the Vue CLI

21. Vue Files & Templates
Every Vue components contains different parts:
- template
- script (optional)
- style (optional)

App.vue has export method, which has components property. This components property is used to register imported components.


22. Template Refs
Template Refs is just like query selector concept in JavaScript.
Template Refs allows to store reference to a DOM element inside variable. Then when
we have that reference ,we can use regular JavaScript methods and properties on it
to do things like changing classes, style...

eg:
<input type="text" ref="name">
handleClick() {
    console.log(this.$refs.name);
    this.$refs.name.classList.add('active');
    this.$refs.name.focus();
}
